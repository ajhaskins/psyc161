## Course Objectives

Neuroimaging, computational neuroscience and other fields of brain
research directions are becoming more and more data driven and
employing sophisticated computational methods and paradigms, such as
distributed and cloud computing.  That is why it becomes critical for
new researchers to develop at least basic skills in programming,
software engineering, code and data management. This course intends to
provide wide in scope and introductory in depth coverage of many
important topics in programming, software engineering and some data
structures and algorithms to streamline students current and future
research projects. It will be practice and interaction oriented in its
format: lectures will be interleaved within practice hands-on
sessions. Although some topics and home exercises will involve using
established data analysis frameworks, primary accent will be made on
getting a good grasp of good coding and software developing practices:
collaboration, testing, code review, etc.  Thus, this course is
intended to serve as a prerequisite to possible follow-up course(s)
which would concentrate on in-depth learning of specific neuroimaging
(and/or computational neuroscience) frameworks (from stimuli delivery
to advanced analysis pipelines).


# Resources

## Software

Neuroimaging could be considered a somewhat exemplar field of science
since nearly all scientific software for fMRI and EEG/MEG data
analysis was developed as a free and open source software (FOSS).
Moreover, with recent developments of stimuli delivery toolboxes
(e.g., psychtoolbox-3, PsychoPy, OpenSesame) it became possible to
provide a complete free and open toolbelt for carrying out research in
this domain.  Therefore, in this course we will use/cover available
FOSS tools (e.g., bash, [git](http://git-scm.com/) and may be developed
in-house [DataLad](http://datalad.org)) to improve our skills not only
in programming itself, but also to learn basics of code management, data
structures and algorithms, and even some software engineering.
[Python](http://python.org), version 3, will be our primary programming
language.  Besides Python we might learn to compose little snippets in
shell (bash).

Python itself and all the tools we will use/learn are available for any major operating
system (Linux, OS X, MS Windows).  If you are a Debian or Ubuntu user,
you are encouraged to use a turnkey platform for neuroscience --
[NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net) -- where all
aforementioned (and thousands of other) tools are conveniently
available.  Otherwise, use of a `conda` distribution is highly recommended - please visit
https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and download/install Anaconda
(Python 3.7 version) for your OS which will provide you not only Python
itself, but also access to thousand of other Python (and not only)
software packages.
[Conda cheatsheet](https://conda.io/docs/_downloads/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
provides a quick overview of available commands to work with conda.

To establish efficient hands-on sessions and code development in
Python, we will use and recommend you to use in your research/coding
practice:

- [git](https://git-scm.com) Is a [Version Control System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control)
  which we will (learn to) use. Debian/Ubuntu:
  `sudo apt install git`. conda: `conda install git`.
- [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) which will be used for
  interactive work with Python. Available
  for all platforms.  Debian/Ubuntu:
  `sudo apt install python3-notebook`.  conda: `conda install ipython-notebook`
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) community edition is a
  very versatile [Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
  for Python.
  For Debian/Ubuntu systems - [NeuroDebian](http://neuro.debian.net)
  provides now `pycharm-community-sloppy` package you can install.
  Otherwise, download from [the project's website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

## Data

We might possibly use some publicly available dataset as an example
for hands-on sessions. For your project(s), you are welcome to use any
publicly available dataset.  Consider choosing datasets available
through [DataLad](http://datalad.org)
from [datasets.datalad.org](http://datasets.datalad.org).


## Format

This course is planned as a graduate level seminar course for the
Winter 2019 semester -- Jan 3rd to March 13th -- so we will have roughly
11 weeks.  Each week we will have either one 3h or two
1h:30m classes, which would be a mix of small lectures
and practice sessions.  Practice sessions would include “pair
programming” and “code review” sessions.  Homeworks will consist of
exercises in the "online textbook" be submitted
via Git (further instructions TBA).  Students will learn how to
use Git/GitHub and will be encouraged to contribute to existing free
and open-source projects.

In addition, we will make use of a number of other online resources,
including documentation and user manuals for the various libraries and
packages that you will be learning to use.

## Master plan

This is a preliminary plan, which can (and probably will) change
depending on our progress and students' preferences

- **Weeks 1-5**: Get to know Python
  language fundamentals (from variables to modules and classes).
  **FOPP-PBS**. And become efficient with the tools (environments, VCS,
  IDE, QA).

- **Weeks 6-8**: Introduction to the exciting Data Structures and
  Algorithms (sorting, binary search, etc) **PS**

- **Weeks 9-end**: Fundamentals of the scientific Python core (NumPy,
   SciPy, matplotlib, pandas) **PSL**

## Student Evaluation

Students will be evaluated on the basis of:

- Lesson exercises / class participation.
  Every week there will be a set of small exercises to be submitted
  for the first class in the upcoming week. Initially they all should
  be done within the interactive [FOPP-PBS] textbook.  You must be logged in!

- Final project, given 3-4 final weeks to work on.

## Final project

Final project is optional.  Students must complete all homeworks, and
the final project provides "extra credit" benefits.

For the final project, students have two possibilities: self-proposed
or a suggested project.  For a self-proposed project:

- It must be a new development (i.e. not something you did before this
  course), although you can choose to improve upon your prior code

- Ideally should be something **you** or someone would end up re-using
  later on

- Contribution to an existing scientific projects is strongly
  encouraged (benefit from established QA, feedback, distribution
  channels, etc)

- Possible domains can be

    - Data structures/algorithms implementation
    - Stimuli/experiment
    - Data Analysis
    - Establishing/improving quality assurance (tests, etc) of an
    existing scientific FOSS project

- Team work is encouraged (but contribution ratio will be assessed)

Suggested projects will be given in the class.  For any of those types
of projects code must be documented (docstrings, code comments),
follow style guidelines (flake8 run in .travis.yml), carry unit- and
possibly doc-tests, and submitted via GitHub making Travis-CI happy.
You are most welcome to use materials from previous homeworks, and
even review and grab ideas (not cut/pasted code) from code of others.
You can either clone blank
[psyc161-prj](https://github.com/dartmouth-pbs/psyc161-prj) against
which you would submit your solution in private, or create a new
public git repository on github.

## Code of conduct

In non-official words: you must not re-use/cut-paste complete
solutions found online.  You are strongly encouraged to do your best
to try figuring out the solution yourself.  If you are stuck on some
technical detail, it is perfectly fine to consult documentation, even
"ask google", and/or email me for a hint/help.  But if you are fully
stuck ad researched/found a complete solution online and saw/read it
(aren't you a fast reader of Python code by now) -- it is not the end
of the world -- close that page and try recreating that solution
yourself without looking up there again.
